    <p align="justify">The term seems to be used as a casual name for tropical-flavored popsicles or homemade frozen treats. While not a specific brand, it's associated with summer refreshment and combines tropical fruit flavors with yogurt for a healthier alternative to traditional ice pops. These treats are popular for their simplicity and nutritious ingredients.</p>
